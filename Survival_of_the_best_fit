The motivting factor for integrating machine learning was that I wasn't hiring applicants at a satisfactory pace. 
I was able to train a machine to hire the same way i did, by looking at how i hired the first few rounds. It copied my hiring technique and hired at a faster rate. 
Unfortunately, i appeared to have hired more orange people at the beginning, causing the machine to make biased decisions. i was then sued 58 times.
A larger pool of data is necessary for the machine to not make biased decisions. We need people from different backgrounds and more individuals conducting the hiring process.
