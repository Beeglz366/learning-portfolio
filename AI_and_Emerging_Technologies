# AI and Emerging Technologies
#Chosen Emerging Technology is a smart healthcare device like wearable fitness trackers
previous solutions: Before the use of Ai-powered tools, people would have to use traditional methods like tracking their health manually (people would need to record their health metrics like weight, blood preassure, and glucose levels. Its normal but theres a chance of error or lack of consistency), consistent medical check-ups (regularly checking up with a healthcare provider for monotoring health conditions, it could be very time consuming and theres a chance of not catching issues on time), and diagnostic test (it can be time consuming).  
Impact on everyday life: These devises help people monitor their health and makes sure everything is in place. Ai can analyze and detect any health problems one might be having before it becomes a severe problem. A good example would be a diabetes monitor, those things can detect the blood sugar levels and insulin intakes.
