#Data Preprocessing: Imagine you want to have a computer identify video game characters. first we would have to use multiple pictures of the characters we want it to learn about. We organize the pictures with the correct labels, make sure theyre not blurry or weird. Its like organizing our notes for a unit. Once thats done, we have to train our model by going through trial and error.
#Model evaluation: Once our model has been trained we can check how well our computer can identify the video game charaters. To do that, we test it with new data (new pictures) that we havent shown it before. If we're lucky, it will tell us the names just by looking at the new pictures. If it doesnt, it just means that we have to adjust our data and re-train it.
#Machine Learning has been used for Mail purposes. To identify what is transactions, updates, promotions, and spam/junk. The system looks through spam mail and our regular mail to identify common wording or patterns and then it goes through training to be able to send whats spam into Junk and whats actual important mail into our inbox. From there, it can learn to identify more specific things to seperate them into promotions, transactions, and updates.
#machine learning has been replacing many aspects of this world to make it better. It helps algorihtm apps like Netflix, youtube, amazon, or Tiktok show us more of what we want to see, it helps those apps gain recognition and love. ML helps prevent fraud, if theres an odd purchase made that isnt recognize as something the buyer would do, it can notify the buyer that someone probably stole their card information. I can see how police departments could use it to identify a person by using pictures from a survalance camera and the pictures from ID departments. 
#A concern would be our privacy, these systems collect and analyze a lot of personal data. Some of that data could be sensitive and thanks to this, these companies could know more than we would like.
