I had to go throught the popular section and i saw "Alice Adventures in Wonderland" its a beauttiful classic and the only classic that i knew of because i really wanted to know about a story before asking chatgpt, it can be inacurate sometimes. I installed the downloaded story into chat gpt and asked "tell me about this book, what are some important characters and what is the plot of the story?" And asked about the masd hatter's personality to somewhat see if it'll give me an accurate answer, which it did. An issue was that it gave me a vague answer about the plot, it just says what exactly happens but not how. I have to ask multiple specific things for it to give me the answer i want. Chat gpt uses words a person wouldnt use to describe a character, it described the mad hatter as " A quirky character known for his nonsensical tea parties" its a correct description but i would say "a silly character who hosts interesting and crazy tea parties" i might be uneducated but i wouldnt use nonsensial. Also, i feel like a human would go more into detail about the type of charcater the mad hatter is instead of a small description.
